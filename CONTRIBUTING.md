3. **Follow the development process** - See below for details

## üîß Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local configuration
   ```

3. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   # Start backend
   npm run dev:backend
   
   # Start frontend (in another terminal)
   npm run dev:frontend
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --testPathPattern=your-test-file
```

### Code Quality Checks

Before submitting your changes, ensure they pass all quality checks:

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Run all checks
npm run check-all
```

## üé® Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful component and prop names
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow the single responsibility principle

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Keep custom CSS to a minimum
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic class names when custom CSS is needed

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add OAuth 2.0 authentication
fix(api): resolve user data validation error
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Process
